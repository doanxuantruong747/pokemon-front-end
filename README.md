## Doan Xuan Truong
## Pokédex

In the pokemon world, there are hundreds of pokemon species. In this world, a trainer's best friend is the Pokedex - a pocket wiki about all pokemon where they could find, categorize, and search for a pokemon. 

We are going to create a web application Pokedex that helps trainers around the world learn more about their favorite pokemon.

### Front-end: UI Requirements
